# TODO make it so private info isn't shown to non-admins
# TODO also make visibility an enum: public, private, followers
#       - when viewing another user's profile, only see public
#       - also see followers if you're a follower
#       - only show public on homepage
#       - also need to prevent guests from accessing all this stuff

Things to do:
  - add more analysis? if possible
  - MAYBE? password reset feature
  - explore changing design if have time (probably won't)
  - time doesn't account for time zones :/
  - WIP make toast messages nice
  - TODO make table headers use keys as well to distinguish between features with the same name

Things completed:
  - DONE admin pages (view all users)
    - for view all users:
      - DONE id, username, email, numModels, view (shows profile)
  - DONE when viewing another user's profile:
    - DONE only see public models
    - DONE don't see 'followers' or 'edit'
        - DONE perhaps give user stats (e.g. number of public models?) (if have time)
    - DONE add a follow button (except for guests)
    - DONE if user is admin
      - DONE allow to see all info
      - GETTING RID password field
      - DONE admins can update emails and usernames
        - GETTING RID hopefully can bypass current_password check if admin?
  - DONE add a followers tab? probably trivial
    - DONE can definitely count from db easily to show total (for both)
  - DONE expand homepage info (not hugely important)
  - DONE maybe add blocking/remove follower functionality (latter seems better tbh)
  - DONE add notes field to fmodel
  - DONE make fmodel visibility an enum? (public, private, followers)
  - DONE fix seeds (duplicate followers, make names realistic (chatGPT) for demo, e.g.)
  - DONE handle user deletion correctly (i.e. follows & names on fmodels)
  - DONE on view all fmodels:
    - DONE make table headers sortable?
  - DONE searching would be nice (for users and models)
  - DONE user verification (prevent guests and non-admins seeing pages)
  - DONE verify feature models before saving, and return more detailed
    errors to user using toast popups
  - DONE fix issue with Void Test (links back to mor rigid fm verification)
