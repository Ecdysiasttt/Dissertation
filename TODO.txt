# TODO make it so private info isn't shown to non-admins
# TODO also make visibility an enum: public, private, followers
#       - when viewing another user's profile, only see public
#       - also see followers if you're a follower
#       - only show public on homepage
#       - also need to prevent guests from accessing all this stuff

Things to do:
  - admin pages (view all users)
    - for view all users:
      - id, username, email, numModels, view (shows profile)
      - handle user deletion correctly (i.e. follows & names on fmodels)
  - verify feature models before saving, and return more detailed
    errors to user using toast popups
  - when viewing another user's profile:
      - DONE only see public models
      - DONE don't see 'followers' or 'edit'
          - DONE perhaps give user stats (e.g. number of public models?) (if have time)
      - NEXT add a follow button (except for guests)
      - NEXT if user is admin
        - allow to see all info
        - EXCEPT password field
        - admins can update emails and usernames
          - hopefully can bypass current_password check if admin?
  - add a followers tab? probably trivial
    - can definitely count from db easily to show total (for both)
  - fix issue with Void Test (links back to mor rigid fm verification)
  - make fmodel visibility an enum? (public, private, followers)
  - maybe add blocking/remove follower functionality (latter seems better tbh)
  - add more analysis? if possible
  - expand homepage info (not hugely important)
  - user verification (prevent guests and non-admins seeing pages)
  - explore changing design if have time (probably won't)
  - on view all fmodels:
    - make table headers sortable?
  - fix seeds (duplicate followers, make names realistic (chatGPT) for demo, e.g.)
  - time doesn't account for time zones :/
  - make toast messages nice
  - add notes field to fmodel
